# Formal Abstracts

This repository contains the current state of the [Formal Abstracts Project](https://formalabstracts.github.io/). We are currently in the design phase, and figuring out how to structure the project. We are not actively seeking contributions at this time.

Contributors, please use `git pull -r` to pull and use `git rebase` instead of `git merge`.
